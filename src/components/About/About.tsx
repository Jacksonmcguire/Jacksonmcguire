          Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. 
          My interest in web development started back in 2012 when 
          I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out 
          hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
        </p>
        <p>Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at
          an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. 
          My main focus these days is building accessible, 
          inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.
